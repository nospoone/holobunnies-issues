# Holobunnies Issues
This repo doesn't have any code, it's only used for the [waffle.io board](https://waffle.io/nospoone/holobunnies-issues). People with access to the beta can report issues and bug they encouter. This way of doing stuff was [@larsiusprime](https://github.com/larsiusprime)'s idea, and this README is mostly copied from [his own issues repo](https://github.com/larsiusprime/tdrpg-bugs). Thanks Lars! :+1::ok_hand:

# Instructions (for testers)

### 1. Log in / Sign up for a Github account
You'll need a [Github account](https://github.com/join) to report issues and bugs.

### 2. Follow along on the [waffle.io board](https://waffle.io/nospoone/holobunnies-issues).
Waffle.io is a more convenient interface for viewing github issues. However, you can also just use this repository directly to view the raw data, and to report new stuff.

### 2a. Ask to become a collaborator if you're _really serious_
Normal users can't add labels and do much besides create and comment on issues. But if you really like hanging out on our bugtracker for some reason, I can make you a collaborator and give you more power. It's like being a forum moderator, but for bug tracking. Just ping `@nospoone` in some issue comment and we'll sort it out.

### 3. Learn how to report a bug! *This is very important!*

In order to fix a bug, we have to be able to reproduce the error or problem you've encountered. Therefore, please follow the example format below (or just take a look at the [issue template](https://github.com/nospoone/holobunnies-issues/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)).

#### Basic Information:
```
Operating System  : Windows XP
Version #         : PC/53B7021/SA
Optional Info     : I was using a netbook with a maximum native resolution of 1024x768
```

- Version # is at the top right (e.g. `PC/53B7021/SA`).
- Optional info is just anything else you think might be important

*This information lets us know which build/version of the game has a problem*

#### Steps to reproduce:
```
1. Open the PC computer
2. Select the Brawler Mode
3. Select any options
4. Change character at least 11 times in the character select
5. Choose Leenox
6. Start Game
```

*If we can't reproduce the bug, we can't fix it!*

#### What was expected:
```
I expected to have Leenox as my character.
```

*Knowing what you were actually expecting to happen is much more helpful than only knowing what the error was.*

#### What actually happened:
```
I had Danielle as my character.
```

*This lets us know what the allegedly bad result was.*
